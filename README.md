# Simple Obfuscate Text from Robots
Inspired by Facebook splitting of "Sponsored" text to bypass adblockers:
![Facebook Sponsored](images/facebook.jpg "Facebook Sponsored")

My intention is make it a little bit harder for basic scrapers to obtain emails, and phone numbers on my website.

# Usage
```
import ObfuscateText from "react-obfuscate-text";
<ObfuscateText text="this@is.email" />
```
